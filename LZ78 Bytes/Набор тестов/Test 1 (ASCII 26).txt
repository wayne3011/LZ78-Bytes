When it is very cold, specially when there is a cold wind, few people want to go outside, unless they have to; but on sunny winter days, winter sports are popular.
In the large flat regions in the middle of North America, the most popular winter sports are  snowmobiling, snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing. Ice-skating is popular too; lakes and rivers freeze, and many towns and cities have free open-air skating rinks. In many places, these are flood-lit after dark, so that people can enjoy skating in the evening.
However, for many people, real "winter sports" means downhill skiing; and in the USA, there are two main areas for this; the Adirondack Mountains in the North East, and the Rockies in the west.
The Rockies are probably the best place in the world for skiing. North America's "continental" climate means that the snow that falls here is usually very dry, very powdery. It provides perfect skiing conditions in the most famous skiing resorts, which are mostly situated at a height of over 2000 metres.
sThe best resorts are in Colorado and Utah, where the air is usually beautifully clear through the winter months. Colorado has America's most famous skiing resorts, Vail and Aspen, where the stars and the rich go for their winter holidays. But the great ski areas of Utah are just as good, with miles and miles of slopes.
